# OrbTk Widget Templates

Within this sub-section we are going to collect and discuss the
structure of officially provided OrbTk widget `Templates`. We hope to
cover interesting aspects.

For each template type we do provide a simple reference application,
that will show the features and functionality offered by the
illustrated code. Take the in-lined comments and anchors as a tutorial
on how to take advantage of the presented logic while including the
widget inside your own `OrbTk` code. If we did well, you can
concentrate on the parts we like to emphasize.

Inside the library, the collection of the annotated example code is filed in
the sub-directory [`listings`][listings].
